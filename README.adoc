== Narrative

[quote]
____
In order to have awesome *living documentation* +
As a bdd developer +
I want to convert my test results into http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[Asciidoc format^].
____

== Story

****
[big]#*GIVEN*# I execute my cucumber tests using the json formatter

[BIG]#*AND*# cucumber json output files are generated

[big]#*WHEN*# I convert the files using Cukedoctor

[big]#*THEN*# I should have awesome _living_ documentation based on asciidoc.
****

== Sample

The following cucumber feature:

----
@a
Feature: One passing scenario, one failing scenario

  @b
  Scenario: Passing
    Given this step passes

  @c
  Scenario: Failing
    Given this step fails
----


will be converted by Cukedoctor (after tests execution) into the following document:
