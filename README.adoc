Documentation is generated based on Cucumber http://www.relishapp.com/cucumber/cucumber/docs/formatters/json-output-formatter[JSON execution output].

****
[big]#*GIVEN*# we have cucumber execution *json* files

[big]#*WHEN*# we run Cukedoctor reporter against those files

[big]#*THEN*# we should have awesome _living_ documentation generated by Asciidoctor
****

== Sample

Here is a cucumber json file which is the result of a test execution:
