== Story

****
[big]#*GIVEN*# I have cucumber execution *json* files

[big]#*WHEN*# I run Cukedoctor reporter against those files

[big]#*THEN*# I should have awesome _living_ documentation generated by Asciidoctor
****

== Sample

Here is a cucumber json file which is the result of a test execution:
